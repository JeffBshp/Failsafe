# This is an example program that can run inside the game.
# Its syntax is similar to C, but it is interpreted, not compiled (for now anyway).
# The idea is that the player can write programs that interact with the game world.
# For example, creating scripts for robots that move around, harvest materials, manufacture objects, and build structures.
# For now, the only thing this virtual program can do is call a function that prints to the console.



# File should contain a single root function with any name (may change how this works later)
int main
	()				# Function parameter list (no params in this example)
	(int localInt)	# Local variables (must be declared here, in the function signature; may change later)
{
	localInt = 0;			# Assign a value to a local variable

	while (localInt < 10)	# There are "while" loops, but not "for" loops
	{
		localInt = localInt + 1;	# Arithmetic operation
		
		print("Hello", localInt);	# Call an external function
		
		if (localInt == 5)			# Conditional execution with "if" (no "else" yet)
		{
			print("Halfway Point", localInt);
		}
	}
	
	return localInt;		# Return a value
}
